This was a practical activity undertaken as part of the Cisco DevNet Associate qualification. It is a piece of Python code illustrating how to use multiple API calls
to automate exisiting Cisco platforms in this case Webex. The code creates a message within a Webex room which prints the name of a city to the message board of the 
room. Based on this information the code takes the name and calls the Mapquest API to get the GPS co-ordinates of the city in question and once it has the
co-ordinates makes a further  API call to the ISS Pass times API which returns the pass times of the International Space Station as it passes overhead
the mentioned city. This was a useful exercise in how to use APIs and Cisco platforms to automate code solutions. As part of this course I also became 
familiar with the following :

•	Researched and wrote academic essay on how DevOps can integrate security more comprehensively.(*)

•	Used Python programming as well as setting up Python virtual environments using PIP. Then on to Object Oriented Python and created unit tests with unittest framework with particular reference to parsing JSON objects returned by API calls and then manipulating with Python. Used Python to also parse YAML via PyYAML. Used YANG-CLI to parse XML. Linux skills - Used Linux for file management and system administration in a VM in conjunction with Python written in Visual Studio code.(*)

•	Implemented a development environment using DevNet resources. Explored and used DevNet Learning Labs, Sandbox and Exchanges to help with automation particularly when accessing Webex platform.(*)

•	Strengthened knowledge of Git version control from inititalizing repositories to branches, merging and handling merge conflicts as well as integrating Git with GitHub. (*)

•	Compared software testing and deployment methods (including continuous integration, continuous deployment and continuous delivery) in automation and simulation environments. Built Jenkins pipeline to tear down any previous running web apps and then build and test a Flask web app stored in Github repository. (*)

•	Used Ansible to back and configure a Cisco router using two VMs(*)

•	Used Ansible to automate the installation of an Apache web server and then used an Ansible playbook to add options to the web server(*)

•	Used pyATS and Genie to extend test automation to software driven network configuration(*)

•	Used software development and design best practices.(*)

•	Created REST API requests over HTTPS to securely integrate services. Learnt about API design and architecture styles, how to authenticate to APIs, how to use web hooks and how to understand API rate limits as well as how to troubleshoot common problems with APIs. Used Postman to simulate at first and then moved on to creating automated Python scripts to interact with Mapquest and other APIs.(*)

•	Understood the processes and devices that support network connectivity including knowledge of ethernet, MAC addresses, switching and VLANs, IPv4 addressing against IPv6 addressing, routers and routing, networking protocols including DHCP, DNS, SNMP, NTP, NAT. Use of Packet Tracer to show practical examples of these.(*)

•	Used ifconfig, ping, traceroute, nslookup to troubleshoot common network problems(*)

•	Used current technologies to deploy and secure applications and data in a cloud environment. Understood differences between different types of cloud (private, public, hybrid, edge) Technologies included creating Docker containers and building a Python Flask web app within that container.(*)

•	Compare Cisco platforms used for collaboration, infrastructure management, and automation.(*)
